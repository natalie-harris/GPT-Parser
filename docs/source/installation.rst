Installation
============

Installing with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ GPTPipelines==0.0.1

Note: The install command is pretty long since the project is currently stored on test.pypi.org instead of pypi.org. This will change in the future!
